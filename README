ActsAsConfirmable
=================

I wanted to use a boolean to represent whether a video had been recorded or not, but then I soon needed to know who had said that it had been recorded and when. So, the need for this plugin arose. Note, this plugin only cares about things that have been confirmed as true, e.g. it does allow someone to confirm that on a specific date a test was not done.

It currently assumes that there is a Users table and it is hardwired to obtain the confirmer/user from User.current_user. If that fails it will assign the id 1 as the confirmer and unfortunately fail when the confirmer is requested.


Example
=======

# rails confirm
# cd confirm
# script/generate scaffold user name:string
# script/generate scaffold item name:string started_confirmed_by:integer started_confirmed_at:datetime finished_confirmed_by:integer finished_confirmed_at:datetime ready_confirmed_by:integer ready_confirmed_at:datetime

class Item < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_confirmable :started, :finished, :ready
end

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  cattr_accessor :current_user
end

class ItemsController < ApplicationController
  before_filter :load_user
  
  def load_user
    User.current_user = User.find(:first)
  end
end

items/new.html.erb

<p>
  <%= f.label :started %><br />
  <%= f.check_box :started %> 
</p>
<p>
  <%= f.label :finished %><br />
  <%= f.check_box :finished %> 
</p>
<p>
  <%= f.label :ready %><br />
  <%= f.check_box :ready %> 
</p>

items/list.html.erb

<td><%=h item.started? %> <%= item.started_confirmer.name if item.started? %></td>
